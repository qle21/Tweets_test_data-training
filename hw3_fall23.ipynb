        "_According to the **Academic Integrity Policy** of this course, all work submitted for grading must be done individually, unless otherwise specified. While we encourage you to talk to your peers and learn from them, this interaction must be superficial with regards to all work submitted for grading. This means you cannot work in teams, you cannot work side-by-side, you cannot submit someone else’s work (partial or complete) as your own. In particular, note that you are guilty of academic dishonesty if you extend or receive any kind of unauthorized assistance. Absolutely no transfer of program code between students is permitted (paper or electronic), and you may not solicit code from family, friends, or online forums. Other examples of academic dishonesty include emailing your program to another student, copying-pasting code from the internet, working in a group on a homework assignment, and allowing a tutor, TA, or another individual to write an answer for you. Academic dishonesty is unacceptable, and penalties range from failure to expulsion from the university; cases are handled via the official student conduct process described at https://dos.uic.edu/conductforstudents.shtml._\n",

The context should be the part of speech (POS) for that word. The good news is you do not have to manually write out the lexical categories for each word because [nltk.pos_tag()](https://www.nltk.org/book/ch05.html) will do this for you.

But before that, as you may have guessed, the number of possible words is prohibitively large and not all of them may be useful for our classification task. We need to determine which words to retain, and which to omit. A common heuristic is to construct a frequency distribution of words in the corpus and prune out the head and tail of the distribution. The intuition of the above operation is as follows. Very common words (i.e. stopwords) add almost no information regarding similarity of two pieces of text. Similarly with very rare words. NLTK has a list of in-built stop words which is a good substitute for head of the distribution. We will consider a word rare if it occurs only in a single document (row) in whole of `tweets_train.csv`.\n",

You need to pass a parameter `min_df=2` to filter out the words occuring only in one document in the whole training set. Remember to ignore the stop words as well. You must leave other optional parameters (e.g., `vocab`, `norm`, etc) at their default values. But you may need to use parameters like `lowercase` and `tokenizer` to handle `processed_tweets` that is a `list` of tokens (not raw text)."

One of group is used as test set for evaluation and other groups as training set. The model or hyperparameter with the best average performance across all k folds is chosen. For this question you will perform 4-fold cross validation to determine the best kernel. We will keep all other hyperparameters default for now. This approach provides robustness toward biasness in validation set. However, it takes more time.\n",

We will go with accuracy. According to wiki, **accuracy** of a classifier measures the fraction of all data points that are correctly classified by it; it is the ratio of the number of correct classifications to the total number of (correct and incorrect) classifications. `sklearn.metrics` provides a number of performance metrics.\n",

Write code to split the training data into 4-folds (75% training and 25% validation) by shuffling randomly. For each kernel, record the average accuracy for all folds and determine the best classifier. Since our dataset is balanced (both classes are in almost equal propertion), `sklearn.model_selection.KFold` [doc](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.model_selection.KFold.html) can be used for cross-validation."
