# Tweets Test Data Training

## Overview

Welcome to the Tweets Test Data Training project! This repository is dedicated to training and testing machine learning models on a dataset of tweets. As a data scientist or machine learning engineer, your role is pivotal in developing and fine-tuning models to accurately predict or classify tweets based on a predefined theme.

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to build and assess machine learning models that can effectively categorize tweets into predefined themes. This task involves training on a labeled dataset and evaluating the model's performance on a separate test dataset. The outcome will contribute to the development of a robust and accurate tweet classification system.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed on your machine:

- Python (version 3.7 or higher)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional but recommended for interactive model development)
- Required Python packages (scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, etc.)

You can install the necessary packages using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements
```

### Repository Structure

- **data:** Contains the training and test datasets. Ensure that you have the latest versions before starting model development.
- **notebooks:** Jupyter Notebooks for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- **scripts:** Python scripts for specific tasks, such as data cleaning and feature engineering.

## Contributing

We encourage contributions from the community to enhance the model's performance and explore innovative approaches. If you have ideas for feature engineering, model architecture improvements, or any other suggestions, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
